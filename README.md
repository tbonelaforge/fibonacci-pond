Minimimizing the number of hops a "Fibonacci Frog" must take to get across a pond.

If a frog can only take hops of size f, where f is a fibonacci number,
and there are only certain lilly-pad locations for the frog to land on while crossing the pond,
what is the minimum number of hops the frog can make to cross the pond?
